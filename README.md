# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis: 
  A schoolboard is concerned that there has been academic dishonesty and they would like us to remove the school and grade in question from their dataset.
## Results: 
How is the district summary affected?
 

o	How is the school summary affected?





	We can see similar changes to the school summary dataframe because we have removed the 9th grade of Thomas Highschool we would expect to see some changes. We also made some formatting changes that can as well be seen.
o	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
	It does not really affect Thomas High School that much as they are still one of the top 5 schools. 
	However we cannot see their scores for the 9th grade so it is hard to compare that grade to other schools for reading. 
o	How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
	Math and reading scores by grade
1.	The math scores seem to be unaffected, however the reading for the 9th grade of Thomas High School are Nan so we cannot see that data which will change the results slightly. 
	Scores by school spending
1.	Again we cannot see how Thomas High School compares to the other schools because their values are now null.
	Scores by school size
1.	Not affected
	Scores by school type
1.	Also not affected
